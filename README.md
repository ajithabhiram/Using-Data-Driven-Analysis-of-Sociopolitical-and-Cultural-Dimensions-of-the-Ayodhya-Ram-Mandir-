**# Using-Data-Driven-Analysis-of-Sociopolitical-and-Cultural-Dimensions-of-the-Ayodhya-Ram-Mandir-**# 🛕 Ayodhya Ram Mandir: A Socio-Cultural, Legal, and Technological Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive study on the Ayodhya Ram Mandir, examining its cultural, political, legal, and technological dimensions. It critically explores how the construction of the temple influences Indian society — especially in relation to identity politics, urban development, heritage preservation, and religious technology.

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze the multi-dimensional impact of the Ram Mandir construction by combining:

- Historical and legal developments
- Societal and minority perspectives
- Urban cultural transformation of Ayodhya
- Role of emerging technologies in religious practices

## 📚 Key Focus Areas

### 1. **Societal and Queer Perspectives**
- Examined the role of queer communities, especially *Kinnar Akhada*, and their representation in the Hindutva narrative.
- Analyzed the political positioning of trans individuals within the Ram Mandir movement.

### 2. **Urban Heritage Development**
- Studied Ayodhya’s transformation into a heritage city.
- Discussed the **Urban Cultural Landscape** framework.
- Evaluated tourism, conservation policies, and intangible cultural elements (e.g., rituals, agriculture).

### 3. **Legal and Historical Timeline**
- Traced the dispute from the **1528 Babri Masjid construction** to the **2019 Supreme Court verdict**.
- Included key events like the **1949 idol installation**, **1992 demolition**, and ASI excavations.
- Analyzed court rulings, secularism debates, and property rights conflicts.

### 4. **Technological Integration**
